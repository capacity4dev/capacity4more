<p>
  Node Gallery uses the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagecache">imagecache</a> module to
  generate image derivatives such as thumbnails or smaller display sizes. Imagecache provides
  the technology to dynamically generate images when the file is accessed for the first time.
  It offers different actions that it can execute on images, such as resizing or cropping a file
  to specified dimensions. These actions are grouped into so called "presets". The module uses the
  file path to determine which preset it should use on an Image.

  During the installation of Node Gallery, three such imagecache presets are generated, corresponding
  to different contexts:
  <ul>
    <li>node-gallery-thumbnail: A preset that will be applied to thumbnails, e.g. displayed on gallery summaries and teasers.</li>
    <li>node-gallery-cover: A preset that will be applied when only the cover image is displayed for a gallery.</li>
    <li>node-gallery-display: A preset that will be applied to images as they appear on their full node page.</li>
    <li>node-gallery-admin-thumbnail: A preset creating a micro thumbnail to display images on administrative pages, such as the manage images and sort images screens.</li>
  </ul>
  The imagecache presets can be freely customized to suit your requirements. To learn how to use imagecache and how to customize those presets,
  please refer to the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/163561">Imagecache documentation on drupal.org</a>.

   Possible topics:
    - Watermarking full size images with imagecache_actions
    - adding borders to images, or foto effects to covers?
    - changing the preset that is used on the views?
