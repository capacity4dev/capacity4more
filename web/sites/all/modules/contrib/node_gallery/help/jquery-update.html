<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
 Node Gallery makes use of jquery and optionally of the jquery_ui module. Some drupal modules, however, require a newer version of jQuery to work.
 If for example you choose to use colorbox to display your images, you also need to enable the jquery_update module. This might cause some problems,
 e.g. the custom sorting of gallery images might fail. This is due to a conflict between your version of jquery_ui and the jquery version provided
 by jquery_update.
</p>
<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p>
You can see what versions are in use of your site if you visit your status report page.
The version of jQuery targeted by a release jQuery UI are mentioned in the release notes.
As a rule of thumb these combinations work well together:
<ul>
  <li>jquery 1.2 -> jquery UI 1.6</li>
  <li>jquery 1.3 -> jquery UI 1.7</li>
  <li>jquery 1.4 -> jquery UI 1.8</li>
</ul>
<p>
So check which version of jquery is in use and (if necessary) install a compatible version of jquery UI.
If you don't know how to do that take a look at this tutorial: http://drupal.org/node/1078080

<p>
After uploading the new version of jquery_ui you only have to flush your caches (at mysite.com/admin/settings/performance or via the link provided by the admin menu module which you should be using) and you are good to go.
