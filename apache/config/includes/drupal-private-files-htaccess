#
# By default, Drupal has set the following line here:
# Deny from all
#
# But DIGIT needs different configuration because:
#   - They use Apache 2.4.20
#   - The directives "Order deny,allow", "Allow from â€¦" are not supported by 2.4.x
#   - The module "mod_access_compat" (compatibility module with previous versions of Apache httpd 2.x) is not allowed
#
# So the following lines replaces Drupal's default "Deny from all".
#
<IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
  Require all denied
</IfModule>
<IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
  Deny from all
</IfModule>
