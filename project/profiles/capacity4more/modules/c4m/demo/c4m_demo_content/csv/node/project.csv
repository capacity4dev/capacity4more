The new Lusail City to the northern side of Qatar will cover a 38km2 site which will eventually house up to 200,000 people. The $45bn project is being developed in several different zones containing residential, commercial and financial districts. It will include a new waterfront, a $275m mall, 22 hotels, two golf courses and four offshore islands.

It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project. The project was proposed and funded by the US government ; planning started in 1984, the project got underway in 1990, and was declared complete in 2003. A parallel project was conducted outside of government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-spnsored sequencing was performed in universities and research centres in China, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States",t_wind,Worldwide,group_5,,0

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Khalifa Al Thani in 2013 as part of Lusail City‚Äôs masterplan to create a sustainable, integrated community, Zaha Hadid designed two projects for Al Alfia Holding. Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA) will now develop the first project, a 70,000 sq m hotel with residential apartments to complete in 2020, in Lusail City‚Äôs Marina District. The second of Hadid‚Äôs designs commissioned by Al Alfia Holding will be built within the on-going plan for future development of the city.</p><p>Designed with innovative solutions as an environmentally sustainable community of 450,000 residents and visitors, Lusail City incorporates a 38km light rail system to transport them throughout the city with direct connection to the wider Doha Metro network. Integrating its management and conservation of water within an urban landscape, the city‚Äôs energy, communications and transportation systems are also planned to automatically adapt to continually changing weather and traffic conditions, making Lusail the most sustainable city in the region.</p><p>Continuing these ecological considerations, the formal composition of Hadid‚Äôs design has been inspired by the structure of the Desert Hyacinth; a flowering plant native to the landscapes and coastlines of the Arabian Gulf. The nine-pointed form of the building‚Äôs podium surrounds a central core defined by the interwoven fluid geometries of the hyacinth. A filigreed mashrabiya fa√ßade envelops the building to reduce solar gain.</p><p>Fluidity is embedded within the region‚Äôs architectural heritage and traditions. Continuous calligraphic and geometric patterns flow from domes to ceilings, ceilings to walls, walls to floors, establishing seamless relationships and blurring distinctions between architectural elements.</p><p>Zaha Hadid developed this historical understanding of the region‚Äôs architecture in a contemporary interpretation evolving from her research into natural systems of organization and structure, as well as applying the possibilities achieved through advancements in design, construction and material technologies to deliver workable solutions for the 21st century.</p><p>&laquo;We often look at nature‚Äôs systems when we work to create environments; at her unrivalled logic and coherence,&raquo; Zaha Hadid previously explained.</p><p>Hadid‚Äôs work sees form and space composed into fluid spatial progressions. Transforming notions of what can be achieved in concrete, steel and glass, Zaha Hadid‚Äôs architecture combines her unwavering optimism for the future and belief in the power of invention with concepts of connectivity and fluidity.</p><p>Working with Arup Engineering and Atelier Ten, global leaders in environmental design and engineering, Zaha Hadid Architects‚Äô vision for the 38-storey project embraces collaboration between disciplines, responding to current and future environmental challenges and providing the most comfortable living spaces for residents, guests, visitors and staff.</p><p>&laquo;With truly inspirational public spaces and atrium, 120 unique residences and 200 hotel rooms of Zaha Hadid‚Äôs unmistakable signature, we celebrate her remarkable legacy and continue Lusail City‚Äôs commitment to creating the region‚Äôs most sustainable, interconnected community,&raquo; said H.H.
