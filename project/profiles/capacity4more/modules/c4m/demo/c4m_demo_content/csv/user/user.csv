user_1,mariecurie,drupal,radioactive@curie.fr,Maria Salomea,Skłodowska-Curie,"Marie Skłodowska-Curie (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.",mariecurie.jpg,PoRa 84-88,government,PL,t_earth,t_earth,Poland,administrator
user_2,isaacnewton,drupal,isaac@gravity.com,Isaac,Newton,"Sir Isaac Newton PRS MP (/ˈnjuːtən/ 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1727) was an English physicist and mathematician (described in his own day as a ‘natural philosopher’) who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica(‘Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy’), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of calculus.",isaacnewton.jpg,F=m.a,academic,GB,t_electricity,t_earth,Worldwide|Trinidad and Tobago,
user_3,badhairday,drupal,albert@emc2.com,Albert,Einstein,"Albert Einstein (/ˈælbərt ˈaɪnstaɪn/; German: [ˈalbɐt ˈaɪnʃtaɪn] 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed ‘the world's most famous equation’). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ‘for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect’. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.",alberteinstein.jpeg,E=mc2,academic,DE,,,Germany,

His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the 'father of modern observational astronomy', the 'father of modern physics', the 'father of science', and 'the Father of Modern Science'.",galilei.jpg,Telescopia,academic,IT,t_earth,t_earth,Italy,

He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.",charlesdarwin.jpg,The Daily Darwin,academic,GB,t_wind,t_fire,United Kingdom,administrator

He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of 'algorithm' and 'computation' with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered as the 'Father of Theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.",alanturing.gif,Turing Testing Inc.,government,GB,,,United Kingdom,
