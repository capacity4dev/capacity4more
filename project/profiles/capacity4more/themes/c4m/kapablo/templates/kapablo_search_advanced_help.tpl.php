    <p>You can use these tips to focus your search.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for combined wording by adding &quot;speech marks&quot; around several words; for ex: <cite>&quot;sustainable energy&quot;</cite></li>
      <li>By adding AND between words, for ex: <cite>Energy AND Water</cite>; your result(s) will include multiple terms.</li>
      <li>By adding OR between words, for ex: <cite>Energy OR Water</cite>; your result(s) will include either or both terms.</li>
      <li>By adding a space and a minus sign, for ex: <cite>Energy -Water</cite>; your result(s) will include a term but not the other (search for 'energy' but not 'water')</li>
    </ul>
