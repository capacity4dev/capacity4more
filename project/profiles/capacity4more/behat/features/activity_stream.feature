Feature: Test activity stream
  In order to see recent content in the group
  As a group member and non-member
  I need to be able to see an activity stream of recent operations

  @javascript
  Scenario: Check message is created after Discussion is created in my public group
    Given a group "Discussion Insert 1" with "Public" access is created with group manager "isaacnewton"
    When  I am logged in as user "isaacnewton"
    And   a "discussion" is created with title "Discussion added 1" and topic "Fire" in the group "Discussion Insert 1"
    And   I am logged in as user "isaacnewton"
    Then  I should see "Discussion added 1" in the activity stream of the group "Discussion Insert 1"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Check author is displayed by Firstname + Lastname
