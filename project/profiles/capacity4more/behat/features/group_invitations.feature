  As a group member and non-member
  In order to invite users and visitors
  I need to be able to access the group invitation forms

    Given I am logged in as user "charlesbabbage"
    When  I visit the dashboard of group "Music Lovers"

    And   I click "Invite a member"
    And   I click "Invite Visitors"
    Then  I should not see "Access denied"
    And   I should see the text "Invite Visitors"
