Feature: Group dashboard
  As a group member and non-member
  In order to see the group latest activity and information
  I need to be able to see a dashboard with different widgets

  @api
  Scenario: Check dashboard content as group owner
    Given I am logged in as user "mariecurie"
    When  I visit the dashboard of group "Movie Popcorn Corner"
    Then  I should see the group dashboard with quick post form

  @api
  Scenario: Check dashboard is not accessable for not member of the private group.
    Given I am logged in as user "mariecurie"
    When  I change access of group "Movie Popcorn Corner" to "Private"
    And   I am logged in as user "president"
    And   I visit the dashboard of group "Movie Popcorn Corner"
    Then  I should see "User account"

  @api
  Scenario: Check dashboard is not accessable for not member of the group with restricted access.
    Given I am logged in as user "mariecurie"
