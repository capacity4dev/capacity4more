  Scenario: Check projects landing page as an anonymous user
    Given I am an anonymous user

    And I should see the sidebar facet with title "Type"
    And I should see the sidebar facet with title "Stage"
    And I should see the sidebar facet with title "Topics"
    And I should see the sidebar facet with title "Regions & Countries"
    And I should be able to sort the overview
