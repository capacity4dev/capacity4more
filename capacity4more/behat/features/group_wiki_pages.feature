Feature: Group Wiki pages
  As a group member, group administrator and non-member
  I need to be able to see a WIKI detail page
  As a group member I need to see an unpublished WIKI detail page if I have
  the OG permission to 'view unpublished group content'
  As a non-member I cannot see an unpublished WIKI detail page even if I have
  the OG permission to 'view unpublished group content'
  As anonymous user I cannot see an unpublished WIKI detail page

  @api
  Scenario: Check Wiki detail as an anonymous user
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I visit the page "wiki/prizes" in the group "Nobel Prize"
    Then I should see the Wiki detail page
      And I should not see the wiki create links
