article_1,"Gene Therapy Achieves Major Success","<p>Have blood cancers met their match? Certainly, the enthusiasm greeting gene-therapy results presented in early December at a hematology conference seemed to indicate so. The new weapon against leukemia, however, is not perfect; still, it marks a significant achievement. </p><p>In a study begun in 2010 on adults and children suffering from chronic and acute forms of leukemia, researchers extracted the patients' T cells—the immune system’s targeted torpedoes against invaders. The researchers then genetically modified the T cells to recognize a protein that only exists on cancerous cells and to rapidly proliferate on meeting them. Injected back into the patients, the engineered cells could then seek out and destroy those cells. </p><p>Preliminary analyses suggest that positive responses can occur up to two thirds of the time. In a study of 27 patients with acute leukemia, 24 showed complete remission one month after treatment, although six have since relapsed. In another study of 15 patients, six showed complete remission and another six showed a partial response. </p><p>Other scientists at the conference also reported positive results with gene therapy on other conditions, including SCID-X1, or 'bubble boy' disease. Treatment restored the immune systems of eight of nine boys. </p><p>In addition to the reported successes, none of the studies uncovered serious side effects of gene therapy, which in past clinical trials led to a few deaths—most notably that of Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, which set the field back many years. The latest results suggest that gene therapy has turned an important corner and is on the verge of becoming a viable treatment option for life-threatening conditions. Look for an overview article scheduled for the March 2014 Scientific American.</p>",genetherapy.jpg,0,,"Falkland Islands (Malvinas)|Grenada|Caribbean|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","Have blood cancers met their match?

article_2,"The First Neutrinos from Outside the Solar System","<p>For the first time this year astronomers caught neutrinos originating in distant galaxies, an advance that heralds the start of a new era in astronomy—the era of seeing with particles, not just light. </p><p>Scientists have been studying neutrinos for decades, but almost all of the neutrinos here on Earth come from nearby sources—either our own sun or from high-energy cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. This year astronomers using the IceCube detector at the South Pole reported the discovery of 28 neutrinosthat were so energetic they could not have possibly originated in these local sources. (Researchers named the two most powerful neutrinos ‘Ernie’ and ‘Bert’ after the beloved Sesame Street characters.) </p><p>As for what spawned these ultrapowerful neutrinos, speculation abounds—the particles didn’t all arrive in a single spurt and appear to come from random directions on the sky. Once scientists can correlate the location of a neutrino burst to an optical counterpart—possibly coming from an energetic, short-lived object like a supernova—the era of neutrino astrophysics will begin in earnest.</p>",neutrinos.jpg,1,t_earth,"United States of America","For the first time this year astronomers caught neutrinos originating in distant galaxies, an advance that heralds the start of a new era in astronomy—the era of seeing with particles, not just light.",banner2.jpg,user_5
article_3,"Recovery of Oldest Human DNA","<p>For all the astonishing advances in ancient DNA research in recent years, scientists have maintained that they would never be able to sequence DNA from human fossils more than about 100,000 years old. But in December a team reported that it had managed to recover well-preserved DNA from a 400,000-year-old thighbone belonging to an extinct member of the human family.</p>",oldestdna.jpg,1,t_earth,Spain|Andorra,"For all the astonishing advances in ancient DNA research in recent years, scientists have maintained that they would never be able to sequence DNA from human fossils more than about 100,000 years old.",banner3.jpg,user_2
article_4,"The exothermic chemical process of combustion","<p>Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products. Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition.</p><p>The flame is the visible portion of the fire. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.</p><p>Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. Fire has been used by humans for cooking, generating heat, light, signaling, and propulsion purposes. The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is fixed from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.</p>",combustion.jpg,1,t_earth,France|Paris,"The flame is the visible portion of the fire.

article_6,"2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami","<p>The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on 26 December with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The event is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake.[6][7] The resulting tsunami was given various names, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, South Asian tsunami, Indonesian tsunami, the Christmas tsunami and the Boxing Day tsunami.</p><p>The undersea megathrust earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing 230,000 people in 14 countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 metres (100 ft) high.[8] It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand.</p><p>With a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3, it is the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph. The earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes.[9] It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 centimetre (0.4 inches)[10] and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska.[11] Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia.[12] The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response. In all, the worldwide community donated more than $14 billion (2004 US$) in humanitarian aid.[13]</p>",earthquake.jpg,1,t_earth,Belgium|Brussels,"The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred on 26 December with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia.",banner6.jpg,user_2
article_7,"Water for Electricity","<p>All types of electricity generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility or fuel, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources as photovoltaic solar and wind power, which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build the turbines and solar panels. If a wind turbine is mounted on a concrete or steel tower, additional tonnes of water are required in the tower's construction.</p><p>In the US, about 2 US gallons (7.6 L) of water is evaporated to create one kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.[2] This water is consumed in thermoelectric plants which are power plants converting waste heat into electrical power and evaporated in reservoirs for hydroelectric plants. An average of 18 gal (68 L) of fresh water is evaporated to generate 1 kWh of electricity at a Hydroelectric plants.[2] The production of electricity to power one 60W incandescent light bulb over the course of a year would evaporate about 3,000 to 6,300 US gallons (24,000 L) of water.[3]</p><p>Thermal power plants require large amounts of cooling water. 39% of all freshwater withdrawals in the USA are used for thermoelectric energy production.[4] Most of the cooling water is returned but at a higher temperature, and only around 3% is actually consumed, mostly by evaporation.[5] The demand for cooling water can be in competition with agriculture and municipal demands in some areas with the demand for water for irrigation around 40% overall.[5] As a result of climate change some rivers are running lower in the summer, putting additional strain on power production.</p>",water_electricity.jpg,1,t_water,Spain|Madrid,"All types of electricity generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility or fuel.",banner1.jpg,user_3
article_8,"Electricity for Water","<p>As energy requires water, water supply and sewage disposal needs energy. Drinking water must be pumped to the treatment plant, pre-treated, and then pumped to consumers. In areas where fresh water is scarce and drinking water must be brought in from a long distance, the energy footprint for this drinking water is extremely high. The energy consumed for pumping groundwater is typically between 537 kWh and 2,270 kWh per million gallons depending on pumping depth, but as an example, southern California receives potable water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta which travels over low-lying mountains and requires 9,200 kWh per million gallons.[7]</p><p>Treatment of wastewater and stormwater can also consume significant energy. Combined sewer systems use the same pipes for conveying stormwater and wastewater. During precipitation events, stormwater can swell and even overwhelm the shared pipe resulting in sewer overflows, extra wastewater treatment, and flooding. There are nearly 800 cities with combined sewer systems in the US.[8] Many municipalities are in the process of installing storage tunnels and high rate treatment facilities to store and treat the large volume of storm/sewer water during precipitation events. The overflow captured and treated at these new facilities is projected to be in the billions of gallons annually per city and will only increase the water-related energy consumption in these communities. Even areas with newer, separate stormwater systems still experience infiltration and inflow of runoff in sanitary sewers and must treat stormwater at wastewater treatment facilities.</p><p>According to the River Network, the U.S. consumes at least 521 million MWh a year for water-related purposes which is the equivalent to 13% of the nation’s electricity consumption.[7] The energy required to heat water is even higher. Fuel oil, propane, electricity, and natural gas are used to heat water in the US, all together consuming the kWh equivalent of 304.2 billion kWh each year.[7] Water related energy use in California alone including the conveyance, storage, treatment, distribution, wastewater collection, treatment, and discharge sectors, consumes 19 percent of the state’s electricity, 30 percent of its natural gas, and 88 billion US gallons (330,000,000 m3) of diesel fuel annually.[9]</p>",generator.jpg,1,t_water,Germany|Berlin,"As energy requires water, water supply and sewage disposal needs energy.

article_9,"Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia","<p>Drinking water. Despite clear improvements the quality of service remains insufficient. For example, few cities enjoy continued service, and water pressure is often inadequate. In Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days. This is still better than in 2008, when the respective figures were 5 and 23 days.[3] While systematic data on service quality are now available for several cities, they are not publicly available. In some localities groundwater used for drinking water supply is naturally contaminated with levels of fluoride in excess of the recommended level of 0.7 to 1.2 mg/l. For example, a 1990 study showed that the fluoride level in drinking water in Mecca was 2.5 mg/l.[5] In Riyadh the level of fluoride is reduced far below the recommended level by blending groundwater with desalinated seawater.[6]</p><p>Wastewater. There are 33 wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of 748 million cubic meters per year, and 15 more are under construction. Much of the treated wastewater is being reused to water green spaces in the cities (landscaping), for irrigation in agriculture and other uses.</p><p>Concentrated sewage from septic tanks is collected through trucks. In Jeddah the trucks dumped sewage for 25 years in a valley that was euphemistically called the Musk Lake. The pond, holding more than 50 million cubic meters of sewage, almost overflowed during heavy rains in November 2009 threatening to flood parts of the city. After that, the King ordered the lake to be dried up within a year with the help of the National Water Company.[7]</p>",dubai.jpg,1,t_water,Italy|Rome,"Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia is characterized by significant investments in seawater desalination, water distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment leading to a substantial increase in access to drinking water and sanitation over the past decades.",banner3.jpg,user_5
article_10,"Man-made reclamation of deserts for ecological reasons","<p>Once the (fresh or sea)water has been attained in centralized systems it must be distributed. This can be done using dug canals or in some instances aqueducts (which are both the least attractive option since they allow much water to be evaporated), troughs (as used in the Keita Project[3]), earthenware piping (semi-open or closed) or even underground systems i.e. qanāt.</p><p>Depending on the method of distribution of the water, it can then be provided on different methods to the plants. A costly solution (used only on pipes) is drip irrigation. Other methods are the use of wadis (basically V-shaped ponds dug in the earth) or by simply planting the trees in holes inside/over the water pipe itself. The tree's roots can then suck the water straight from the water pipe (used in qanāt, hydroponics, ...) A similar technique can be done with semi-open pipes (i.e. dug throughs in the Keita Project).</p>",desert.jpg,1,t_water,Germany|Munchen,"Depending on the method of distribution of the water, it can then be provided on different methods to the plants.

article_11,"Stronger wind speeds are available offshore","<p>Offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in bodies of water to generate electricity from wind. Stronger wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher,[1] and NIMBY opposition to construction is usually much weaker. However, offshore wind farms are relatively expensive.[2] At the end of 2012, 1,662 turbines at 55 offshore wind farms across 10 European countries were generating electricity enough to power almost five million households.[3]</p><p>As of 2010 Siemens and Vestas were turbine suppliers for 90% of offshore wind power, while Dong Energy, Vattenfall and E.on were the leading offshore operators.[1] As of October 2010, 3.16 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to BTM Consult, more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the United Kingdom and Germany will become the two leading markets. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the United States.[1]</p><p>As of 2013 the 630 MW London Array is the largest offshore wind farm in the world, with the 504 megawatt (MW) Greater Gabbard wind farm is the second largest, followed by the 367 MW Walney Wind Farm. All are off the coast of the UK. These projects will be dwarfed by subsequent wind farms that are in the pipeline, including Dogger Bank at 7,200 MW, Norfolk Bank (7,200 MW), and Irish Sea (4,200 MW). At the end of June 2013 total European combined offshore wind energy capacity was 6,040 MW. UK installed 513.5 MW offshore windpower in the first half year of 2013.[4]</p>",windturbine.jpg,1,t_wind,Spain|Andorra,"Offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in bodies of water to generate electricity from wind.",banner5.jpg,user_1
article_12,"A millennium of windmill development and modern engineering","<p>Not all the energy of blowing wind can be harvested, since conservation of mass requires that as much mass of air exits the turbine as enters it. Betz's law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 59% of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine.[14]</p><p>Further inefficiencies, such as rotor blade friction and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. Commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind, at rated operating speed.[15][16]</p><p>Efficiency can decrease slightly over time due to wear. Analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in Denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease, while the other half saw a production decrease of 1.2% per year.[17]</p>",windmills.jpg,1,t_wind,Belgium|Brussels,"The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types.",banner6.jpg,user_2
