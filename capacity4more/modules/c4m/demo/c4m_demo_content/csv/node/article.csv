article_1,Gene Therapy Achieves Major Success,"<p>Have blood cancers met their match? Certainly, the enthusiasm greeting gene-therapy results presented in early December at a hematology conference seemed to indicate so. The new weapon against leukemia, however, is not perfect; still, it marks a significant achievement. </p><p>In a study begun in 2010 on adults and children suffering from chronic and acute forms of leukemia, researchers extracted the patients' T cells—the immune system’s targeted torpedoes against invaders. The researchers then genetically modified the T cells to recognize a protein that only exists on cancerous cells and to rapidly proliferate on meeting them. Injected back into the patients, the engineered cells could then seek out and destroy those cells. </p><p>Preliminary analyses suggest that positive responses can occur up to two thirds of the time. In a study of 27 patients with acute leukemia, 24 showed complete remission one month after treatment, although six have since relapsed. In another study of 15 patients, six showed complete remission and another six showed a partial response. </p><p>Other scientists at the conference also reported positive results with gene therapy on other conditions, including SCID-X1, or 'bubble boy' disease. Treatment restored the immune systems of eight of nine boys. </p><p>In addition to the reported successes, none of the studies uncovered serious side effects of gene therapy, which in past clinical trials led to a few deaths—most notably that of Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, which set the field back many years. The latest results suggest that gene therapy has turned an important corner and is on the verge of becoming a viable treatment option for life-threatening conditions.

article_2,The First Neutrinos from Outside the Solar System, "<p>For the first time this year astronomers caught neutrinos originating in distant galaxies, an advance that heralds the start of a new era in astronomy—the era of seeing with particles, not just light. </p><p>Scientists have been studying neutrinos for decades, but almost all of the neutrinos here on Earth come from nearby sources—either our own sun or from high-energy cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. This year astronomers using the IceCube detector at the South Pole reported the discovery of 28 neutrinosthat were so energetic they could not have possibly originated in these local sources. (Researchers named the two most powerful neutrinos ‘Ernie’ and ‘Bert’ after the beloved Sesame Street characters.) </p><p>As for what spawned these ultrapowerful neutrinos, speculation abounds—the particles didn’t all arrive in a single spurt and appear to come from random directions on the sky. Once scientists can correlate the location of a neutrino burst to an optical counterpart—possibly coming from an energetic, short-lived object like a supernova—the era of neutrino astrophysics will begin in earnest.</p>",neutrinos.jpg,1,topic_earth,,user_5
article_3,Recovery of Oldest Human DNA,"<p>For all the astonishing advances in ancient DNA research in recent years, scientists have maintained that they would never be able to sequence DNA from human fossils more than about 100,000 years old. But in December a team reported that it had managed to recover well-preserved DNA from a 400,000-year-old thighbone belonging to an extinct member of the human family.</p>",oldestdna.jpg,1,topic_earth,geo_3,user_2
