topic_earth,Earth,th_elements,t_earth,banner_earth.jpg,earth.jpg,"Earth, also known as the Earth and the World, is the third planet from the Sun and the densest planet in the Solar System. It is also the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets. It is sometimes referred to as the Blue Planet, the Blue Marble, Terra or Gaia.",group_2,project_1|project_2,article_1|article_4,user_1
topic_wind,Wind,th_elements,t_wind,banner-wind.jpg,wind.jpg,"Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in our solar system occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspect, one important aspect is its velocity, another the density of the gas involved, another is the energy content or wind energy of a wind.",group_1|group_3,,article_1,user_2
topic_fire,Fire,th_elements,t_fire,banner-fire.jpg,fire.jpg,"Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.[1] Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition.",group_3,project_1|project_2,article_1|article_2,user_3
topic_water,Water,th_elements,t_water,banner-water.jpg,water.jpg,"Water is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H2O. A water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds. Water is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice, and gaseous state, steam (water vapor).",group_5,project_1,article_4|article_5|article_6|article_7|article_8,user_2
topic_gas,Gas,th_energy,t_gas,banner-gas.jpg,gas.JPG,"Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.",group_6|group_7|group_8,,,user_1
topic_electricity,Electricity,th_energy,t_electricity,banner-electricity.jpg,electricity.jpg,"Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electrical current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.",group_1|group_2,project_2,,user_2
