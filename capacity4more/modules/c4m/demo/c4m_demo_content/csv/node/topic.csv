In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space.

The strongest observed winds on a planet in our solar system occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspect, one important aspect is its velocity; another the density of the gas involved; another is the energy content or wind energy of a wind.",wind.jpg,user_2
